Crunch-It
=========

In this project we analyze the data provided by CrunchBase, a database of facts about companies managed by <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">Tech Crunch</a>. We explore several pieces of information, including mergers, acquisitions, IPOs, and venture capital funding. We also look at descriptive data about each company including the company status, the type of industry (mobile, search, advertising, etc.) and the geographic location of companies and their investors. Ultimately we aim to identify interesting trends in the data and better understand patterns of acquisitions and investments, as well as how these trends have changed over time.

This project uses the following Python libraries:
* ipython 2.0
* Pandas 
* Pylab
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* mpl_d3
* geopy
